# NLP article classification

This model was made for a bootcamp assignment.  There was a preprepared dataset taken from
the 20 newsgroups dataset.  The model classified the articles into one of 10 categories.

There are 2 main files:
* model.py -- can be used for model training, data preprocessing and predictions.
* model.pickle -- a trained model.
